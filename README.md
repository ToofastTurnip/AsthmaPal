# Asthma Pal
Asthma Pal uses live data from trusted APIs to present an environmental safety rating in a quick, light, and easy-to-read format.
# Note
Because this app uses a crappy api, the request cannot be completed unless you open your browser with `open -a Google\ Chrome --args --disable-web-security --user-data-dir` (you don't have to use chrome though)
